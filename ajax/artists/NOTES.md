# HERE WE'RE GOING TO NOTATE IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT STANDS OUT. IT WON'T BE A STEP BY STEP TUTORIAL BUT RATHER IT'LL FOCUS ON THINGS THAT STAND OUT

## THE CURRENT UNHANDLED PROMISE REJECTION BUG: I have the same bug in my main project. Because of this, and because I already tested every aspect of the codebase, it's safe to say that the bug has to do with a recent change mongo db atlas made, and nothing to do with the code base. I'm almost sure that that change has to do with api keys, and how clients accesss the api. I'll have to learn how api keys work on mongo atlas.

## BUG FIXED!: As suspected mongo db atlas changed their format in order to make it more secure for project owners. After reading documentation and dabbing, I found a way to white list my ip address. I also found out that mongo db atlas no longer lets you whitelist all ip addresses, so from now on, if you want your api to be available to the public, you're going to need to include a range of ip addresses, which is an available option in atlas.
