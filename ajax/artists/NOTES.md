# HERE WE'RE GOING TO NOTATE IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT STANDS OUT. IT WON'T BE A STEP BY STEP TUTORIAL BUT RATHER IT'LL FOCUS ON THINGS THAT STAND OUT

## THE CURRENT UNHANDLED PROMISE REJECTION BUG: I have the same bug in my main project. Because of this, and because I already tested every aspect of the codebase, it's safe to say that the bug has to do with a recent change mongo db atlas made, and nothing to do with the code base. I'm almost sure that that change has to do with api keys, and how clients accesss the api. I'll have to learn how api keys work on mongo atlas.
