## Resources
- Api Url: 'https://learnwebcode.github.io/json-example/animals-1.json'

## Challenges
- xmlhttprequests: Replicate the project inside learnwebcode. Make the api call, and have it render new material every time people click on the button. Once all 3 api calls are set, have the button disappear.

- ajax: Build an express server, and have the user input data into a field, and then have that data show up inside a container using mainly ajax, and as minimal express as possible.

# XMLHTTPREQUESTS/ API CALLS

## New Discoveries
- I was having an insertAdjacentHTML() is not a function bug that I couldn't fix. The reason why is because I was accessing the target element through jQuery, but this method is a js method. And you can't use js methods with jQuery methods, or vise versa.
